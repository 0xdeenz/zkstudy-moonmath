### 3.2.1 Integers, natural numbers, and rational numbers

We use $\mathbb{Z}$ to represent the set of **all** integers, with $\mathbb{N}$ being the set of all positive integers.

We use $\mathbb{Q}$ to represent rational numbers, $\frac{n}{m}$, where $n \in \mathbb{Z}$ and $m \in \mathbb{N}$.

#### Integer factorization
Factoring an integer is computationally expensive, but multiplying its prime factors is not. This is known as a **one-way function**, an invertible function that is easy to compute in one direction, but hard in the opposite.
